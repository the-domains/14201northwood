# Garage/Water filtration

The garage is an oversized 3 car with a 2 tone paint job that makes the garage look more refined and nice. Features a workshop area with TV connection, bright fluorescent lighting, dedicated circuit for deep freezer, and large closet with deep utility sink, perfect for washing dirty hands or filling the mop bucket. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/df63d81b-89ac-41e7-b013-5e4dbc7ade18.jpg)

# Water

The water system is one of the great bonuses of this house besides the generator. Nobody likes water bills and with this house you won't have one! This house has fresh well water from the earth and it taste amazing! People literally want to bottle the water here it taste so good. This well also has very good pressure up to 16 gallons per minute. There is also a central water manifold that allows you to turn off any faucet or appliance from this one location.

Now to the good stuff. This house has a custom whole house water filtration system to keep all the appliances, water heaters, and faucets in great shape. The well water first runs through a sediment filter, then through the water softener (that you'll own), lastly through the carbon filter into the home. This means showers, ice, toilets, tubs, refrigerator....all get clean purified water. Best of all this was designed for super easy maintenance!
