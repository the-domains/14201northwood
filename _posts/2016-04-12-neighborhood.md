Northwood Lake Estates is located in Piedmont, Oklahoma in east Canadian County. Northwood Lake is a community where fishing, skiing, kids running barefoot, and riding bikes brings back memories of our childhood and where you'll find some of the friendliest people around. It's a community where you create plenty of memories for you and your family. 

It's good to come home to Northwood Lake! 

Northwood Lake Estates has been a community since the 1960's. The neighborhood has an established and active Homeowner's Association and Code of Covenants and Restrictions designed to help preserve a high quality of living and maintain the neighborhood's natural resources. Recent covenant changes allow for 12 chicken hens per household, and raised the detached shop size from 960 to 1500sf, thats a 30x50 shop mancave in your backyard! 

Northwood Lake Estates currently has 320 homes, many with acreage and space to roam in between.  Woods, creeks and unestablished lots make up the rest of the space, in addition to the resident-owned private lake and surrounding property. 

The neighborhood enjoys the benefits of the Piedmont School District, with the elementary aged children attending Northwood Elementary right at the entrance to the neighborhood.
